I'm a passionate frontend developer with a knack for crafting beautiful and user-friendly web experiences. My goal is to create seamless, responsive, and visually appealing applications that leave a lasting impression on users.

I'm deeply passionate about web development and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and turning ideas into elegant and functional code.

I have a strong eye for design and a deep understanding of user experience principles. I believe in the power of creating intuitive interfaces that not only look great but also provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Management, which equipped me with problem-solving, communication, and project coordination skills. I discovered my passion for coding during my studies and focused on frontend development. 

I completed various online courses to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design. Additionally, I gained experience with popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. Through personal projects, I applied my knowledge, built interactive websites, and integrated APIs. I'm committed to staying updated with the latest frontend technologies.
