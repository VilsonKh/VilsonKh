 ## About me
 <hr/>
  My expertise lies in crafting the visual and interactive aspects of websites and web applications. I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the building blocks of front-end development. Your proficiency in these languages enables you to structure web content, style it with precision, and add interactivity to enhance user engagement.
 
  Attention to detail is one of my standout traits as a front-end developer. I understand the importance of pixel-perfect designs and have honed my skills in implementing responsive layouts that seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes and devices. My keen eye for design and aesthetics allows me to create visually appealing interfaces that not only attract users but also provide an intuitive and delightful user experience.
